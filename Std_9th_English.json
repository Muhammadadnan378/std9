Hence, you can't withdraw cash over the Internet so you still have to visit your bank's physical location or pay service fees by withdrawing money at an ATM that's not associated with your bank. Another disadvantage of online banks would be.'Customer Service': Although online banks have implemented chatting features and offer customer service numbers for those with questions and inquiries, it still doesn't compare to the customer service you'll receive by banking at a physical bank location.Security Risks: Next drawback of internet banking could be 'Most banks make sure that their websites are secure, but no bank website is immune from cybercrime and hacking. Hackers target bank websites to swipe account information. Other pitfalls of online banking include difficulty in getting on to the internet at certain times of day-weekday evenings are the most popular. Internet connection is required for Net banking. If the bank's server is down or internet speed is slow then the online transaction is not possible.
